## Your assignment

To find out if this seminar is the right one for you, look through the [open issues](https://github.com/pancetta/RSE_seminar_TUHH_2/issues).
Those show the different tasks available for this seminar, incl. their required expertise you need to bring with you.

If you decide to participate in this seminar, sign up at TUHH and attend the introductory meeting (see [timeline](timeline.md)). 
After this, the bidding phase for the tasks starts, ending with assignments for all interested students.

You will then be brought into contact with the research team behind your task. 
They will take over the day-to-day supervision for the whole semester.

In addition, there are two mandatory milestone meetings, where you should briefly report on your progress, potential obstacles, thoughts, questions etc.
At the end of the semester, this seminar is concluded with a colloqium.
For this, you are expected to create a deck of slides showing your results. This should contain at least the following items:

1. A **short introduction** to the code: what is the purpose of the code/what is the scientific use case, describe the implementation (language/style, architecture, what algorithm(s), ...), show examples, e.g., using a live demo or screenshots, a movie etc.
2. A **description of your task** and the **status quo**: what was your task and why was it important to the team, what was the situation you joined the team?
3. Your **solution**: What did you do, how, and why? What was the outcome? Did you succeed, what did you learn, was there a direct benefit for the team?

Your presentation should take about 30 minutes. In addition, we will have about 10 minutes for questions afterwards. Besides the presentation, you are expected to submit a short description of your work (4 pages), following the structure above. Please upload both presentation and report to the issue.
